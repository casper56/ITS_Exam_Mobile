1. Database Design
1.1 Given a scenario, design tables for storing data
• Identify entities, rows/records, columns/fields
1.2 Given a scenario, identify the appropriate primary key
• Primary key, composite/compound key
1.3 Given a scenario, choose data types to meet requirements
• Definition and importance of data types; how data types affect storage
requirements; data types for storing text, numbers, dates and times, and
Boolean values
1.4 Given a scenario, design relationships between tables
• How to establish relationships using primary and foreign keys, entity-
relationship diagrams (ERDs), referential integrity
1.5 Normalize a database
• Reasons for normalization, how to normalize a database to third normal
form (3NF)
1.6 Given a scenario, identify data protection measures
• Backups, restore, principle of least privilege, GRANT, WITH GRANT
OPTION, REVOKE, purpose of roles, when to use encryption, hashing, and
masking, purpose of auditing
2. Database Object Management using DDL
2.1 Construct and analyze queries that create, alter, and drop tables
• Create, alter, and drop tables by using proper ANSI SQL syntax; NULL and
NOT NULL
2.2 Construct and analyze queries that create, alter, and drop views
• Create, alter, and drop views by using proper ANSI SQL syntax; purpose of
views
2.3 Construct and analyze stored procedures and functions
• Input and output parameters, return values, purpose of stored procedures
2.4 Given a scenario, choose between clustered and non-clustered
indexes
• When to use clustered vs. non-clustered indexes, syntax for creating
indexes
IT SPECIALIST EXAM OBJECTIVES
Databases
Candidates for this exam are seeking to prove introductory knowledge of how to design,
create, and query relational databases, such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Oracle.
Candidates should have at least 150 hours of instruction or hands-on experience
with database design and object management, data retrieval and manipulation, and
related troubleshooting. Candidates should be able to write ANSI SQL statements and
troubleshoot syntax errors and runtime errors.
The syntax in the exam is provided in ANSI SQL.
